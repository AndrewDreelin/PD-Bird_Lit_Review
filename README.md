PD-Bird Literature Review: Aims, Hypotheses, and Approach

Understanding how prairie dogs shape animal communities is a research priority (Davidson et al 2012) and an important knowledge gap for grassland bird conservation (Somershoe 2018). No prior reviews on this topic specifically, but broader review of social, burrowing mammals (Davidson et al 2012).

Aim of the review is to determine the effects of prairie dogs as keystone species on bird communities. Scope is all prairie dog species (just North America) as well as any bird species affected by prairie dogs, but with a focus on obligate and facultative grassland species.

We identified three hypotheses from the literature to evaluate: 1) prairie dog towns increase local occurrence and abundance of bird species that prefer shorter vegetation heights because prairie dog grazing creates more suitable habitat for them, 2) prairie dog towns prairie dog towns change bird community composition compared to nearby grasslandincrease beta diversity of bird communities because prairie dogs towns create habitat heterogeneity within grasslands, and 3) prairie dog towns increase local occurrence and abundance of raptors because prairie dogs are an abundant food source for them. To identify potential biases or knowledge gaps, we examined the representation of differences in geography, seasonality, taxonomy, town size, and response variables across publications.

•  Include papers expressly on effects of prairie dogs on birds (any Cynomys, any bird species)
•  Include papers containing PD community ecology/keystone effects on other taxa that could influence birds indirectly (e.g., arthropods, vegetation, herps)
•  Include papers on sylvatic plague effects on bird population dynamics
•	Exclude papers on prairie dog life history/sociality not relevant to their community ecology
•	Exclude papers on medical/veterinary details of plague that would not be relevant to dynamics of bird population response or community effects
