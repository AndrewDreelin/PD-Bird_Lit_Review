PD-Bird Literature Review: Aims, Hypotheses, and Approach

Understanding how prairie dogs shape animal communities is a research priority (Davidson et al 2012) and an important knowledge gap for grassland bird conservation (Somershoe 2018). No prior reviews on this topic specifically, but broader review of social, burrowing mammals (Davidson et al 2012).

Aim of the review is to determine the effects of prairie dogs as keystone species on bird communities. Scope is all prairie dog species (just North America) as well as any bird species affected by prairie dogs, but with a focus on obligate and facultative grassland species.

Primary questions:
 
1. Hypothesis: prairie dog towns increase local abundance of bird species that prefer shorter vegetation heights/higher disturbance levels because prairie dog grazing creates suitable habitat for them.
 
Prediction: if prairie dog towns increase local abundance of early successional specialist bird species, then a systematic literature review will find consistent empirical support in the results of relevant papers.
 
2. Hypothesis: prairie dog towns increase beta diversity of bird communities because prairie dogs create habitat heterogeneity on their colonies.
 
Prediction: if prairie dogs towns increase beta diversity of bird communities then a systematic literature review will find consistent empirical support in the results of relevant papers.
 
3. Hypothesis: prairie dog towns increase local abundance of raptors because prairie dogs are an abundant food source for them.
 
Prediction: if prairie dog towns increase local abundance of raptors, then a systematic literature review will find consistent empirical support in the results of relevant papers.

•  Include papers expressly on effects of prairie dogs on birds (any Cynomys, any bird species)
•  Include papers containing PD community ecology/keystone effects on other taxa that could influence birds indirectly (e.g., arthropods, vegetation, herps)
•  Include papers on sylvatic plague effects on bird population dynamics
•	Exclude papers on prairie dog life history/sociality not relevant to their community ecology
•	Exclude papers on medical/veterinary details of plague that would not be relevant to dynamics of bird population response or community effects
